Description: JSON-datetime
        =============

        JSON-datetime allows for proper decoding of datetime values contained in JSON
        streams.
        
        The problem
        -----------
        The JSON standard RFC 4627 does not
        support datetime types. These are usually represented as strings and Python 
        decoders end up decoding them as such. Consider the following example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import simplejson as json
        
            >>> test = '{"name": "John Doe", "born": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 10:00:49 UTC"}'
            >>> json.loads(test)
        
        As you can see, in the resulting dictionary ``born`` is still a string.
        
        The solution
        ------------
        JSON-datetime is a very simple wrapper around Python simplejson ``loads`` 
        method. It decodes datetime values contained in JSON strings: 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import jsondatetime as json
        
            >>> test = '{"name": "John Doe", "born": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 10:00:49 UTC"}'
            >>> json.loads(test)
            {'name': 'John Doe', 'born': datetime.datetime(2012, 3, 1, 10, 0 ,49)}
        
        Strings are parsed using ``dateutil.parser.parse`` which is fairly flexible for
        common datetime formats
        
        Custom parsing
        --------------
        Being just a wrapper around the ``loads`` method, you can still use all the
        standard ``loads`` arguments, ``object_hook`` included. This means that you can
        still perform custom parsing of your inbound JSON stream.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ``pip install json-datetime``
